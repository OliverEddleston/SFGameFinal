# Oliver Eddleston's Game #

This is an example C++ application using the SDL library.
It tries to be as nicely C++11 as possible but do keep in
mind that SDL is written in C and, at some stage, you have

## Story ##
There is an invasion of square shaped aliens approacing earth.
The country is in a state of panic and doesnt know what to do.
They fear that the human race as they know it will end, untill...
Mr Triangle, also known as Mr. Tea, offers his services to the planet. 
Mr Tea is an ex special forces officer from the UK, and may be the
worlds only hope.
Battle your way through the wave of enemies, collecting any valuables
as you do.
Will you be able to save the world...?


## Installation of The Game ##
You will have to have the SDL development libraries installed on
your system.  The easiest way to compile is to use a command-line

`$ g++ -c src/Main.cpp`
`$ g++ -o starship src/Main.o -lSDL -lSDL_image`

which will produce an executable file called "starship" in the
top-level directory.  To execute this file do the following

`$ ./starship`
 
from the top-level directory.  The game will expect to find the
`assets` directory under its current working directory.

## Credits ##
The sprites in this game were created by me using GIMP.

The event system is based on [Libsigc++](http://libsigc.sourceforge.net/)
and is used under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html).
